# Managing user accounts

## Creating accounts

The CodeScoring platform supports multiple users with separate accounts. User accounts are created and managed in the `Settings -> Users` section.

To create a new user, go to the form by clicking the **Create New** button and fill in the following fields:

- **Username** — username in the system;
- **First name** — first name;
- **Last name** — last name;
- **Contact email** — email;
- **Proprietor** — affiliation with the organization's department within the system;
- **Access level** — access level within the system;
- **Password** — password for logging into the system;
- **Can create CLI projects via API** – ability to create CLI type projects using API.

The list of created users can be filtered by the following parameters:

- **Proprietor**;
- **Access level**;
- **Active** — an active account;
- **LDAP server** — [LDAP server](/on-premise/how-to/ldap-settings.en/) connected to the system.

## Editing account setings

Created accounts can be edited or deleted in the `Settings -> Users` section. You can add a user to a project with the specified role by clicking the **Add users** button on the "Projects" tab of the user editing page.

The session time for an inactive user is limited. By default, a user's session ends 2 weeks after the last activity, after which you must log in to the system again.

The environment variable (in seconds) `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is available for configuring the session lifetime.

## Separation of access levels

When creating an account, it must be assigned one of the following access levels - **User**, **Administrator**, **Auditor** or **Security Manager**.

### Administrator access level

The Administrator access level provides access to all projects. This access level also allows to view and change all settings in the system without restrictions.

### Security Manager access level

The Security Manager access level provides access to all projects. This access level also allows you to view all security-related sections, but only change policies.

### Auditor access level

The Auditor access level provides access to all projects. This access level also allows to view all settings and projects in the system without the ability to make and save changes.

### User access level

For the User access level, access is organized individually. For each project, access can be provided with the following roles:

- **Viewer** — access only to view analysis results within the project;
- **Developer** — all rights of the Viewer role, as well as access to launching analysis in the web interface, via the agent and via the proxy repository plugin;
- **Owner** — all rights of the Developer role, access to changing project settings and managing access of other project users.

For each role within the **User** access level, CLI project creation via API is available when the **Can create CLI projects via API** parameter is activated in the user profile.

A project can have multiple users with the same roles, including multiple **Owner**. If there are no users in the **Owner** role, only a user with the **Administrator** access level can manage the project.

## Available actions

A more detailed list of available actions for each access level is presented in the table below:

## User groups

Users within the system can be divided into groups. Groups are created and managed in the `Settings -> Groups` section.

To create a new user group, you must go to the form using the **Create New** button and fill in the following fields:

- **Name** — group name;
- **Description** — group description.

Groups can be added to created projects to more easily track users associated with a project.
