# Connecting to a VCS

To add projects (Git repositories) to the system for analysis, you must first create a connection to the version control system (VCS). CodeScoring supports the following platforms:

- GitLab
- GitHub
- BitBucket (Data Center and Server only)
- Azure DevOps Git
- Gitflic
- Other platforms using Git

Integration occurs through two possible mechanisms: Personal Access Token or SSH key. For the Personal Access Token mechanism, it is possible to connect several version control systems with the same address, but different tokens.

After connecting the version control system, it is impossible to change its type (`Instance type`) and address (`Instance URL`).

**Note**: if private NS servers are used to access the version control system, they must be specified in the platform settings. To obtain the appropriate templates, you must contact the vendor.

## Adding an SSH key

1. Copy an existing or generate a new private SSH key in the version control system according to the instructions for:
1. [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html)

## Connecting GitFlic via ssh

1. Create a new ssh key pair without passphase with type **RSA_SHA512**,**SSH_ED25519** or **ECDSA-SHA2-nistp256**.

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -q -f /tmp/id25519
   ```

1. Go to GitFlic web interface, `Settings -> Keys` and add **public** key to GitFlic key pool.

   You can view the contents of the public key using the following command:

   ```
   cat /tmp/id25519.pub
   ```

1. Go to the CodeScoring interface in the `Settings -> SSH Keys` section, open the form for adding a key by clicking the **Setup New** button and add the **private** key to the CodeScoring key pool.

   You can view the contents of the private key using the following command:

   ```
   cat /tmp/id25519
   ```

1. Go to the `Settings -> VCS` section, open the form for adding a VCS by clicking the **Setup New** button and fill in the fields for creating a VCS instance:

   - **Instance name** – VCS connection name;
   - **Instance clone type** – cloning type (select SSH type);
   - **Instance type** – VCS instance type (select Other git type);
   - **Instance url** – the address where VCS is available;
   - **SSH key** – the SSH key created in step 3.

1. Go to the `Settings -> Project` section, open the form for creating a new project by clicking the **Create New** button and fill in the project creation fields:

   - **Repository** – a link to the repository in GitFlic;
   - **VCS** – the name of the VCS instance created in step 6.

   **Important**: due to the specifics of GitFlic and CodeScoring, the standard link to the repository must be modified by removing the `/project/` part of the path. For example:

   ```
   <https://gitflic.ru/project/kovalevaa/utils.git> -> <https://gitflic.ru/kovalevaa/utils.git>_
   ```

1. Save the project.

## Synchronization of data from VCS

CodeScoring automatically synchronizes data from version control systems when adding a project, running analysis, and as part of background tasks. All mechanisms for obtaining and updating data from `git` are described below:

1. When adding a VCS-project, CodeScoring creates a local copy of the repository in `bare` mode and saves it in the project directory.
1. When running SCA, TQI or Secrets analysis, the system downloads the current state of the branch specified in the project settings.
1. Once a month, CodeScoring initiates a background task that synchronizes all connected VCS projects with remote repositories. This is a preventive update that does not replace synchronization when running analysis, but only speeds it up for projects where the analysis has not been performed for a long time.
   - `git fetch` is performed for all VCS projects
   - Tasks are distributed using the Huey tool to evenly distribute the load over the remaining days of the month

**Note:** if you need to synchronize the repository early, you can use a manual code update on the project page in the `Settings -> Projects` section.
