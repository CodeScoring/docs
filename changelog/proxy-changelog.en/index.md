# OSA Proxy Changelog

### [2025.39.2] - 2025-10-22

#### Added

- Implemented metrics for each package manager type, available at `gateway.route.[maven|npm|nuget|pipy].requests`
- When all package versions in a manifest are blocked by the policies, the service now returns a correct error status and the reason for the block instead of an empty manifest
- Implemented warning (`Warn`) logging in case of incorrect configuration if the manifest does not contain links to packages using URLs from `repository.registry`. In rare cases, false positives may appear in the logs, which will be addressed if detected

#### Fixed

- Fixed an error that occurred during JFrog Artifactory requests to the actual `pypi` package index via the `/simple/` route
- In `warmup` & `spectator` modes, version blocking in manifests is no longer performed

### [2025.39.1] - 2025-09-23

#### Package scanning

Two levels of scanning:

- **Manifest scanning** — analyzes and excludes versions blocked by security policies from the manifest
- **Package scanning** — analyzes downloaded package

#### Blocking Unsafe Components

- Policy-blocked versions are excluded from the manifest.
- Downloading of policy-blocked archives is prevented.
- A configurable status code with a blocking message in the status-line is returned.
