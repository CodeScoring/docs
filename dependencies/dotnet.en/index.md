# Working with dependencies in .NET

## NuGet

### Creating a `packages.lock.json` file

1. Enable lock-file support (for .NET 5 and above):

   ```
   dotnet nuget locals all --clear
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   dotnet restore --use-lock-file
   ```

### Creating a `paket.lock` file

1. Create a lock-file:

   ```
   paket install
   ```

### Working with an `sln` manifest

In case an \*.sln manifest is detected while scanning a directory the list of target manifests will be composed of the components described in it. The components which are present in the solution directory but not included will be ignored.

### General Information

- Within the .NET ecosystem, the main manifest is `*.csproj`, with `packages.lock.json` serving as the lock file;
- The `deps.json` file is considered a separate lock file that is automatically generated and is not linked to any other manifests. It specifies dependencies required for the target runtime.
