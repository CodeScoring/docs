### Default File Detection

- **Automatic**: Scans all supported files
- **Recursive**: Searches in subdirectories

Fine-tuning the scan is done by modifying the config.yaml file

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Visual Studio Code installed on your system
- Access to a CodeScoring platform with active credentials
- The codescoring-sca extension distribution for vscode (.vsix)

### Required Permissions

- **File system**: Read project files, write .codescoring files, download executable, execute downloaded CLI
- **Network**: Communication with CodeScoring API
- **VS Code API**: Editor integration

### Step 1: Download the Extension

The extension is provided as a platform-independent file `codescoring-sca-<version>.vsix`.

### Step 2: Install the Extension from VSIX File

1. Open Visual Studio Code
1. Go to **File** → **Preferences** → **Extensions** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac)
1. Click on the **three dots (...)** menu in the top-right corner of the Extensions panel
1. Select **"Install from VSIX..."** from the dropdown menu
1. Navigate to where you saved the `.vsix` file
1. Select the file and click **"Install"**
1. Wait for the installation to complete

### Step 3: Locate the CodeScoring Extension

After installation, you should see the CodeScoring logo in the VS Code Activity Bar (left sidebar).

1. Click on the **CodeScoring icon** in the Activity Bar
1. The **"CODESCORING: CODESCORING SCA"** sidebar panel will open

### Step 4: Configure the Extension

1. In the CodeScoring SCA sidebar panel, click the **"Configure Extension"** button
1. The CodeScoring SCA settings page will open

#### 4.1 Verify the API URL

1. In the settings, locate the **API URL** field
1. You need to use the URL for CodeScoring installed in your organization. Please, contact your administrator.

#### 4.2 Generate and Set the API Token

1. Open a web browser and navigate to: `<API URL>/cabinet/profile`
1. Log into your CodeScoring account
1. Ensure you're on your profile page
1. Find the **"API token"** field
1. Click the **"Generate"** button next to the API token field
1. Copy the generated API token value
1. Return to VS Code settings
1. Click on the **"Set API Token"** link in the plugin settings
1. Paste the copied token when prompted
1. The plugin should display confirmation that the token is valid

#### 4.3 Download Johnny CLI (Optional)

1. Navigate to the downloads page: `<API URL>/download/` (note the trailing slash)
1. Download the latest release executable for your operating system

#### 4.4 Configure Johnny CLI

There are three ways to obtain Johnny CLI for analyzing your dependencies with our service.

**4.4.1 Local platform**

**Prerequisites:**

- Johnny CLI must be downloaded and the file made executable on the system
- The operating system must allow running the executable file (to verify, run the file once in the console with the --help parameter manually)

**Setup Steps:**

1. Set the platform type to Local

1. In VS Code settings, change `installationType` to `local`

1. Or in settings.json:

   ```
   "codescoringSca.installationType": "local"
   ```

1. In the settings, find the `Codescoring Sca: Johnny Cli Path` field marked **[LOCAL INSTALLATION ONLY]**

1. Click on the **"Browse..."** action link

1. Navigate to where you previously downloaded Johnny CLI

1. Select the Johnny CLI executable file

**Note:** If the plugin asks about changing file permissions (chmod +x), click **"Yes"** to allow the plugin to make the file executable.

**4.4.2 Automatic Client Download**

**Prerequisites:**

- API URL must be configured
- API token must be configured and validation must pass successfully

**Configuration Steps:**

1. Set the platform type to Local

1. In VS Code settings, change `installationType` to `local`

1. Or in settings.json:

   ```
   "codescoringSca.installationType": "local"
   ```

1. In the settings, find the `Codescoring Sca: Johnny Cli Path` field marked **[LOCAL platform ONLY]**

1. Clear the value in this field if necessary (empty value is the default)

1. Now on the first scan request, Johnny CLI will be downloaded from the API URL. This will allow you to automatically receive client updates as soon as they become available. The downloaded client will be saved in the following location:

   1. **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/CodeScoring.codescoring-sca/johnny`
   1. **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\CodeScoring.codescoring-sca\johnny.exe`
   1. **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/CodeScoring.codescoring-sca/johnny`

**4.4.3 Using Docker**

Docker installation allows running Johnny CLI in an isolated container, which is useful when you don't want to install it directly on your system.

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker must be installed and running on your system
- Your user must have permissions to execute Docker commands

**Configuration Steps:**

1. Set the platform type to Docker

1. In VS Code settings, change `installationType` to `docker`

1. Or in settings.json:

   ```
   "codescoringSca.installationType": "docker"
   ```

1. Configure the Docker image

1. **Image**: `johnny-depp:2025.29.0` (default)

1. **Registry**: `<codescoring-registry-host>`

1. Sample full image path: `sample-codescoring-registry.com/johnny-depp:2025.29.0`

1. **Optional: Additional Docker Options** Add custom Docker run options if needed:

   ```
   "codescoringSca.dockerOptions": "--memory=2g --cpus=2"
   ```

**How it works:**

- The extension automatically mounts your project directory into the container
- Scanning is performed inside the container, with results saved to your project
- No manual Docker commands are required - the extension handles everything automatically

**Example Docker Configuration:**

```
{
  "codescoringSca.installationType": "docker",
  "codescoringSca.dockerImage": "johnny-depp:2025.29.0",
  "codescoringSca.dockerRegistry": "sample-codescoring-registry.com",
  "codescoringSca.dockerOptions": ""
}
```

**Troubleshooting Docker installation:**

- **"Docker not found"**: Ensure Docker is installed and the `docker` command is in your PATH
- **Permission denied**: Add your user to the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- **Image pull failed**: Check registry credentials and network connection
- **Container exits immediately**: Check VS Code Output panel for detailed error messages

### Step 5: Run Your First Scan

Now that the extension is configured, you can run your first scan for vulnerable dependencies:

#### Method 1: Using the Sidebar Panel

1. Open a project folder in VS Code
1. Click on the CodeScoring icon in the Activity Bar
1. In the "CODESCORING: CODESCORING SCA" sidebar panel, click the **"Run Scan"** button

#### Method 2: Using the Command Palette

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette
1. Type "Run Johnny CLI Scan"
1. Select **"CodeScoring SCA: Run Johnny CLI Scan"** from the list

#### Method 3: Using the Status Bar

1. Look at the bottom status bar of VS Code
1. Find the **"CodeScoring CLI"** indicator
1. Click on it to open the Johnny CLI menu
1. Select **"Run Johnny CLI Scan"** from the list

### Step 6: Fine-tuning the Scan Configuration

After the scan completes, you'll see a new `.codescoring` directory containing:

1. config.yaml - configuration file for Johnny CLI, you can read about it [in this section](/agent/config.en). You can modify this file as it will never be overwritten.
1. report.html - report generated in html format containing Johnny CLI output in colored table format. Overwritten during each scan.
1. bom.json - scan results file created by Johnny CLI in cyclone-dx 1.6 format, it will be loaded automatically and shown in the vulnerabilities panel for any directory opened in VSCode that has .codescoring/bom.json
1. bom.json.N - where N is the scan revision, i.e., 0 is the previous scan, and 5 (for example) is the very first scan, and bom.json.0 will be used for comparison with bom.json (and shown in the DIFF tree) if it exists when opening a new folder

```
your-project/
├── .codescoring/
│   ├── config.yaml       # Scan configuration
│   ├── report.html       # Latest scan report
│   ├── bom.json          # Current vulnerabilities
│   ├── bom.json.0        # Previous scan (comparison)
│   └── bom.json.1        # Older scans...
├── package.json          # Your dependencies
└── ... your code ...
```

#### Example Usage of CodeScoring Scan Configuration

Edit `.codescoring/config.yaml` to customize:

```
scan:
  general:
    ignore:           # Ignore paths
      - node_modules
      - .git
      - test
    with-hashes: true # Include file hashes for exact matching
    only-hashes: false # Use only hash-based detection
  dir:
    no-recursion: false # Prevents from recursively scan directories
```

### Step 7: View Scan Results

After the scan completes:

1. **Check notifications**: Look at the notifications in the bottom-right corner of VS Code, click **"View Report"**
1. **Open the vulnerabilities tree** (opens automatically by default): Use the **"Open Vulnerabilities View"** button from the sidebar panel
1. **Review vulnerabilities**: The vulnerabilities panel will show all detected security issues in your dependencies
1. **Explore details**: You can click on individual vulnerabilities to see detailed information
1. **Apply fixes**: Use quick fix options to update vulnerable dependencies

### Security and Privacy, Data Handling

- **Local scanning**: Code is not sent to servers
- **API communication**: Only metadata is transmitted (your package manager configuration files)
- **Token storage**: VS Code credential secure storage

### Best Practices, Workflow Recommendations

1. **Initial setup**: Full scan when starting a project
1. **Reviews**: Compare BOMs between versions
1. **CI/CD**:
   - **Before commit**: Run full scan
   - **Share configuration**: Commit `.codescoring/config.yaml`
   - **Ignore reports**: Add `report.html` to `.gitignore`
   - **Track BOM changes**: Version control `bom.json` for history
   - **Standardize**: Create team-wide VS Code settings
