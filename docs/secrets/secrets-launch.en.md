## Search for secrets in a single project

To launch the search for secrets, go to the `Secrets` tab of the selected project and click the **Run secrets analysis** button, after which the search for secrets in this project will start.

Depending on the size of the project, the analysis can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.

## Scheduled search for secrets (VCS Projects)

In addition to manual runs, you can set up scheduled analysis of individual projects.

This is controlled on the project page in `Settings -> Projects`. 

By default, the **Secrets Scan Schedule** parameter is set to **Off**. To activate scheduled analysis, you need to select **On** and select time and days of week.

**Note**: Selected time will be treated as UTC +3.

**Note**: Search won't start if no secrets engine configuration for project is selected.

## Search for secrets in all projects

To launch the search for secrets in all projects, go to the `Workmode` section and click the **Run now** button under the **Secrets: scan for projects** heading.
