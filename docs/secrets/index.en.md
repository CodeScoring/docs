# CodeScoring Secrets

## General description

**CodeScoring Secrets** is a module that searches for sensitive information in code (passwords, API keys, tokens) using its own machine learning model, which allows to significantly reduce the number of false positives during scanning.

Secrets are searched using open analysis tools, currently the [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) engine is used.
