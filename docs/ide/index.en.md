# CodeScoring IDE integrations

## Overview

**CodeScoring** provides Software Composition Analysis (SCA) directly within your development environment through specialized IDE plugins. These integrations enable developers to identify and fix vulnerable dependencies in real-time, shifting security left in the development lifecycle.

By integrating vulnerability detection into the IDE, developers can:

- Detect security issues as they write code, not after deployment
- Get instant feedback on dependency vulnerabilities
- Learn about safe versions and use them right in their development environment
- Maintain secure code from the earliest stages of development
- Track components over time

## Available integrations

**CodeScoring** offers plugins for the most popular development environments:

- [Visual Studio Code Extension](/ide/vscode-sca.en)
- [Plugin for JetBrains IDEs](/ide/intellij-sca.en)

Both integrations provide vulnerable component scanning, visual indicators in code, and one-click remediation options, ensuring developers can maintain secure dependencies without disrupting their workflow.
