10. The plugin should display confirmation that the token is valid
    ![Screenshot of token validation notification](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step4-4-token-validated.png)

#### 4.3 Download Johnny CLI (Optional)

1. Navigate to the downloads page: `<API URL>/download/` (note the trailing slash)
2. Download the latest release executable for your operating system

![Screenshot of the GitLab releases page with Johnny CLI executable download links](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step4-5-johnny-download.png)

#### 4.4 Configure Johnny CLI

There are three ways to obtain Johnny CLI for analyzing your dependencies with our service.

**4.4.1 Local Installation**

**Prerequisites:**

- Johnny CLI must be downloaded and the file made executable on the system
- The operating system must allow running the executable file (to verify, run the file once in the console with the --help parameter manually)

**Setup Steps:**

1. Set the installation type to Local
- In VS Code settings, change `installationType` to `local`
- Or in settings.json:
```json
"codescoringSca.installationType": "local"
```
2. In the settings, find the `Codescoring Sca: Johnny Cli Path` field marked **[LOCAL INSTALLATION ONLY]**
3. Click on the **"Browse..."** action link
4. Navigate to where you previously downloaded Johnny CLI
5. Select the Johnny CLI executable file

**Note:** If the plugin asks about changing file permissions (chmod +x), click **"Yes"** to allow the plugin to make the file executable.

![Screenshot of file browser for selecting Johnny CLI executable](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step4-5-file-selection.png)

**4.4.2 Automatic Client Download**

**Prerequisites:**

- API URL must be configured
- API token must be configured and validation must pass successfully

**Configuration Steps:**

1. Set the installation type to Local
- In VS Code settings, change `installationType` to `local`
- Or in settings.json:
  ```json
  "codescoringSca.installationType": "local"
  ```
2. In the settings, find the `Codescoring Sca: Johnny Cli Path` field marked **[LOCAL INSTALLATION ONLY]**
3. Clear the value in this field if necessary (empty value is the default)
4. Now on the first scan request, Johnny CLI will be downloaded from the API URL. This will allow you to automatically receive client updates as soon as they become available. The downloaded client will be saved in the following location:
    1. **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/CodeScoring.codescoring-sca/johnny`
    2. **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\CodeScoring.codescoring-sca\johnny.exe`
    3. **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/CodeScoring.codescoring-sca/johnny`

**4.4.3 Using Docker**

Docker installation allows running Johnny CLI in an isolated container, which is useful when you don't want to install it directly on your system.

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker must be installed and running on your system
- Your user must have permissions to execute Docker commands

**Configuration Steps:**

1. Set the installation type to Docker
- In VS Code settings, change `installationType` to `docker`
- Or in settings.json:
```json
"codescoringSca.installationType": "docker"
```
2. Configure the Docker image
- **Image**: `johnny-depp:2025.29.0` (default)
- **Registry**: `registry-one.codescoring.ru` (default)
- Full image path: `registry-one.codescoring.ru/johnny-depp:2025.29.0`
3. **Optional: Additional Docker Options**
   Add custom Docker run options if needed:
   ```json
   "codescoringSca.dockerOptions": "--memory=2g --cpus=2"
   ```

**How it works:**

- The extension automatically mounts your project directory into the container
- Scanning is performed inside the container, with results saved to your project
- No manual Docker commands are required - the extension handles everything automatically

**Example Docker Configuration:**
```json
{
  "codescoringSca.installationType": "docker",
  "codescoringSca.dockerImage": "johnny-depp:2025.29.0",
  "codescoringSca.dockerRegistry": "registry-one.codescoring.ru",
  "codescoringSca.dockerOptions": ""
}
```

**Troubleshooting Docker Installation:**

- **"Docker not found"**: Ensure Docker is installed and the `docker` command is in your PATH
- **Permission denied**: Add your user to the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- **Image pull failed**: Check registry credentials and network connection
- **Container exits immediately**: Check VS Code Output panel for detailed error messages

### Step 5: Run Your First Scan

Now that the extension is configured, you can run your first scan for vulnerable dependencies:

#### Method 1: Using the Sidebar Panel
1. Open a project folder in VS Code
2. Click on the CodeScoring icon in the Activity Bar
3. In the "CODESCORING: CODESCORING SCA" sidebar panel, click the **"Run Scan"** button

![Screenshot of the Run Scan button in the sidebar panel](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step5-1-panel-scan-button.png)

#### Method 2: Using the Command Palette
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette
2. Type "Run Johnny CLI Scan"
3. Select **"CodeScoring SCA: Run Johnny CLI Scan"** from the list

![Screenshot of the Command Palette with the scan command highlighted](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step5-2-run-from-command-palette.png)

#### Method 3: Using the Status Bar
1. Look at the bottom status bar of VS Code
2. Find the **"CodeScoring CLI"** indicator
3. Click on it to open the Johnny CLI menu
4. Select **"Run Johnny CLI Scan"** from the list

![Screenshot of VS Code status bar with CodeScoring CLI indicator](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step5-3-run-from-status-bar.png)

### Step 6: Fine-tuning the Scan Configuration

After the scan completes, you'll see a new `.codescoring` directory containing:

1. config.yaml - configuration file for Johnny CLI, you can read about it [in this section](/agent/config.en). You can modify this file as it will never be overwritten.
2. report.html - report generated in html format containing Johnny CLI output in colored table format. Overwritten during each scan.
3. bom.json - scan results file created by Johnny CLI in cyclone-dx 1.6 format, it will be loaded automatically and shown in the vulnerabilities panel for any directory opened in VSCode that has .codescoring/bom.json
4. bom.json.N - where N is the scan revision, i.e., 0 is the previous scan, and 5 (for example) is the very first scan, and bom.json.0 will be used for comparison with bom.json (and shown in the DIFF tree) if it exists when opening a new folder

```
your-project/
├── .codescoring/
│   ├── config.yaml       # Scan configuration
│   ├── report.html       # Latest scan report
│   ├── bom.json          # Current vulnerabilities
│   ├── bom.json.0        # Previous scan (comparison)
│   └── bom.json.1        # Older scans...
├── package.json          # Your dependencies
└── ... your code ...
```

#### Example Usage of CodeScoring Scan Configuration
Edit `.codescoring/config.yaml` to customize:
```yaml
scan:
  general:
    ignore:           # Ignore paths
      - node_modules
      - .git
      - test
    with-hashes: true # Include file hashes for exact matching
    only-hashes: false # Use only hash-based detection
  dir:
    no-recursion: false # Prevents from recursively scan directories
```

### Step 7: View Scan Results

After the scan completes:

1. **Check notifications**: Look at the notifications in the bottom-right corner of VS Code, click **"View Report"**
   ![Screenshot of scan completion notification](/assets/img/ide/vscode/step6-1-scan-complete.png)
2. **Open the vulnerabilities tree** (opens automatically by default): Use the **"Open Vulnerabilities View"** button from the sidebar panel
3. **Review vulnerabilities**: The vulnerabilities panel will show all detected security issues in your dependencies
4. **Explore details**: You can click on individual vulnerabilities to see detailed information
5. **Apply fixes**: Use quick fix options to update vulnerable dependencies

### Security and Privacy, Data Handling

- **Local scanning**: Code is not sent to servers
- **API communication**: Only metadata is transmitted (your package manager configuration files)
- **Token storage**: VS Code credential secure storage

### Best Practices, Workflow Recommendations

1. **Initial setup**: Full scan when starting a project
4. **Reviews**: Compare BOMs between versions
3. **CI/CD**:
    - **Before commit**: Run full scan
    - **Share configuration**: Commit `.codescoring/config.yaml`
    - **Ignore reports**: Add `report.html` to `.gitignore`
    - **Track BOM changes**: Version control `bom.json` for history
    - **Standardize**: Create team-wide VS Code settings
