# Data Feeds

To effectively search for threats in open source components, CodeScoring integrates data from more than **20** knowledge sources (feeds). Records from all sources are deduplicated and combined under universal identifiers in the system.

Threat knowledge sources complement the unified **CodeScoring Index** database with information about published components, including its own [protestware feed](/feeds/protestware.en).

This section contains a detailed description of individual feeds and the process of working with them.

Below is a table with the data sources and their update frequency.
