# Viewing TQI analysis results

## Project page

After the analysis is complete, a detailed report containing key metrics, author information, change dynamics, and a list of commits becomes available on the project page in the `TQI -> Projects` section.

### General project statistics

The beginning of the report records key indicators based on the analysis results:

- **Started** – records the moment of the first commit in the repository;
- **Updated** – time of the last committed change;
- **Authors count** – number of developers who made changes to the code base;
- **Commits count** - number of commits in the repository;
- **Merge commits count** number of merge commits in the repository;
- **Total commits count** – total number of commits (commits + merge commit) in the repository;
- **Lines added** – number of added lines of code;
- **Lines modified** - number of modified lines of code;
- **Lines deleted** – number of removed lines of code;
- **Code rate** - mean value of commit changes relative to total LOC in the repository;
- **Newness impact** - added lines share relative to total LOC in the repository;
- **Churn impact** - modified and removed lines share relative to total LOC in the repository;
- **Complexity** – a code complexity indicator based on the number of branches in the program logic;
- **Borrowed code** – identifies sections of code that were copied from other projects within the organization;
- **Donored code** – identifies code fragments transferred from other projects within the organization;
- **Intra clones** – records duplicate sections of code within the project;

### Authors

The list of authors can be viewed as a table. It is possible to change the display of columns and export the table in CSV format.

- **Author** – author's name and email;
- **Start date** – date of the author's first commit;
- **Last seen** – date of the author's last commit in the project;
- **Activity, months** – number of months during which the author actively committed changes;
- **Total commits** – total number of commits made by the author in the project. Details are available on value hover;
- **Complexity** – average cyclomatic complexity of the author's commits in the project;
- **Clones made** – number of borrowed code fragments made by the author;
- **Technologies** – programming languages the author works with (determined by his commits).

### Project dynamics

The history of the project can be tracked using four graphs showing the dynamics of the project according to the following parameters:

- Lines of code & code artifacts addition/deletion history;
- Commits history;
- Authors count;
- Commits complexity;
- Code rate.

The time interval on the graph can be changed using the slider, choosing the period of interest for analysis.

### List of commits with cyclomatic complexity calculation

For each commit, cyclomatic complexity is calculated, and its context is shown:

- **Hash** – unique commit identifier with a link to the version control system;
- **Commit message** – a short description of the changes made, specified by the author when committing;
- **Commit date** – date and time when the change was made;
- **Lines added** – number of lines of code added in the commit;
- **Lines deleted** – number of lines removed in the commit;
- **Complexity** – cyclomatic complexity value calculated based on the changes made;
- **Author** – name of the developer who made the commit.

## Results visualization

### Activity map

The activity map is available in the `TQI –> Projects` section on the **Activity map** tab. It displays all the contributions of authors for the selected time period for a set of projects, which can be filtered by the following parameters:

- **Commit Date** – period during which the commit was made in the version control system;
- **Number of Projects** – total number of projects displayed on the map;
- **Proprietor** – part of the organization that manages the project;
- **Project category** – category assigned within the CodeScoring system;
- **Technologies** – programming languages used in the creation of the project.

The map can also be saved as a PNG image.

### Complexity map

The complexity map is available in the `TQI –> Projects` section on the **Complexity map** tab. It displays the change in the complexity of a set of projects, which can be filtered by the following parameters:

- **Commit Date** – period during which the commit was made in the version control system;
- **Number of Projects** – total number of projects displayed on the map;
- **Proprietor** – part of the organization that manages the project;
- **Project Category** – category assigned within the CodeScoring system;
- **Technologies** – programming languages used within the project.
