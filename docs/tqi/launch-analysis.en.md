# Launching TQI analysis

## Analysis of a single project

After a successful [cloning of a project from VCS](/on-premise/how-to/projects.en) on its page in the `TQI -> Projects` section, it becomes possible to launch two types of analysis:

1. Duplicate analysis
2. Author analysis

After launching the analysis, the process runs in the background, and upon its completion, the results become available on the project page.

## Analysis of all projects

To launch the analysis for all VCS projects in the system, go to the `Settings -> Work mode` section and launch one of the two types of analysis.
