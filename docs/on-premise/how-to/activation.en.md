# Activation

For the operation of the system, it must be activated using the key, which is transferred to the client along with the installation instructions in a separate `.txt` file.

To enter the key, go to `Settings -> Activation Key`, copy the text from the file to the field without any changes and press the **Save** button. If successful, the information on the key will appear and `Status` value will be changed to **active**.
