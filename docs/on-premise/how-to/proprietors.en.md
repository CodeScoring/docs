# Creating proprietors

**Proprietors** are abstract entities within an organization. They make it easy to group projects into different groups of responsible [users](/on-premise/how-to/users).

Entities are managed under `Settings -> Proprietors`. You can go to the policy creation form by clicking the **Create new** button. In the form, it is mandatory to fill in the **Name** field of the proprietor name and optional fields as desired.

## Binding of authors

Within the system there is a possibility to create a link between a code author and a particular proprietor. To do this, you should go to the list of authors using the **Manage authors mapping** button and select the required entity in the Proprietor field.
