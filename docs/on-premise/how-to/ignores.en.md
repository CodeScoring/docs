# Ignoring policies

Triggered policies can be temporarily or permanently ignored during analysis. The ignore condition will allow you to leave policies in the system without receiving alerts about their triggering, for example, if a vulnerability in a component is not applicable to a specific project.

## Creating ignores

Ignore conditions are created and configured in the `Settings -> Policy ignores` section.

To create an ignore condition for one or more policies, click the **Create** button and fill in the following fields:

- **Groups** - project groups to which the ignore is applied;
- **Projects** - projects to which the ignore is applied;
- **Container images** - images in registries to which the ignore is applied;
- **Technology** - programming language or ecosystem;
- **Dependency PURL** â€” [package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec), component identifier;
- **Dependency name**;
- **Dependency version**;
- **License**;
- **Vulnerability ID** - vulnerability identifier;
- **Policies**;
- **Active** - ignore state;
- **Activation date** - date from which the ignore will start working;
- **End date** - date after which the ignore will stop working;
- **Note**.

## Ignore results

The policies that were subject to the ignore condition are displayed on the "Ignored" tab of the `Alerts` section.

Triggered active policies can also be quickly ignored from the "Active" tab using the **Ignore** button.
