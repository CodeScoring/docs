# Audit log

Audit log is a journal of events in the **Codescoring** system. It is located at `Settings -> Audit log`.

In the audit log all the system events, user actions and errors are listed. Each event contains the following data:

- **Event time** - date and time of event;
- **Actor** - username (for system actions the value is `system`);
- **Message** - a message with details;
- **Duration** - the duration of analysis and integration events.

The records in the journal can be filtered by date range or username, and specific events can be found using the **Search** field. Exporting of the journal in CSV format is also available.

Events in the audit log are divided into several categories. Below is a complete list of possible events for each category, along with their descriptions.

## Activation

## Authentication of the user

| Text of the event | Decoding |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------
|*User logged in*| The user has successfully logged into the system |
