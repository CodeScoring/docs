# Working with dependency graph

Open Source dependencies of software projects represent a graph â€“ a structure in which individual components are depicted as nods, and the connections between them as edges.

You can see the visualization of the dependency graph in the `Dependencies` section or on the project page by clicking on the corresponding icon in the list of dependencies.

On the page with interactive visualization, components are presented by the level of nesting - from the root dependency to the deepest level of transitive dependencies. By hovering cursor over the objects, you can see more detailed information about components: version, environment, technology and number of vulnerabilities.

Visualization is interactive and scalable. By choosing a component, you can track its path of entering the project. Components with found vulnerabilities are indicated by color.

Components on the graph can be filtered according to the following parameters:

- technology;
- development environment;
- severity of vulnerability.
