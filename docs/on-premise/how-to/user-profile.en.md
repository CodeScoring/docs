# Configuring user profile

The **Profile** section allows users to view and update their personal information and customize the interface appearance.

The profile can be accessed by clicking on the username in the bottom-left corner of the interface.

The page displays the following parameters:

- **Username** — a unique login used to access the system. Cannot be edited;
- **Access level** — defines the user's permissions. Available values: `User`, `Auditor`, or `Administrator`;
- **Proprietor** — the organizational unit the user belongs to (if used);
- **First name** — shown in the interface and reports;
- **Last name** — shown in the interface and reports;
- **Email** — contact address displayed in user lists;
- **API token** — used for integration with external tools. Can be copied or regenerated (the previous one becomes invalid);
- **Number format** — numeric display format in the system;
- **Date format** — date display format.

**Important**: number and date format affect display only. They do not influence data input or export.

## Editing the profile

Click the **Edit** button to open the profile editing form. The following fields can be updated:

- First name
- Last name

Changes are saved immediately after clicking **Save**.
