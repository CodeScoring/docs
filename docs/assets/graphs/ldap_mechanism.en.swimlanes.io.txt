title: CodeScoring LDAP Auth Flow

User -> CodeScoring: passes data about the user and the LDAP server, requests authentication

//
if: LDAP Settings are not configured with service user credentials

CodeScoring -> LDAP: `bind` with user credentials

//
else: LDAP Settings are configured with service user credentials

CodeScoring -> LDAP: `bind` with user credentials
CodeScoring <- LDAP:
CodeScoring -> LDAP: `rebind` with service user credentials
CodeScoring <- LDAP:
//
end

CodeScoring -> LDAP: `search` for user record
CodeScoring <- LDAP:
CodeScoring -> LDAP: `unbind`
CodeScoring <- LDAP:

//
if: could not establish the connection or find the user record

User <- CodeScoring: responds with failed authentication

//
else: established the connection and found the user record

CodeScoring -> CodeScoring: creates or updates a user record in the system
User <- CodeScoring: responds with authentication success

//
end
