# Functional characteristics

## General functional characteristics

The modular platform for secure development **CodeScoring** provides solutions for the problems of secure use of **open source**, identification of secrets in code and assessment of development quality.

The platform includes the following modules:

- **CodeScoring.OSA (Open Source Analysis)** – supply chain protection: verification of third-party components for compliance with security policies and blocking in case of non-compliance;
- **CodeScoring.SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** – compositional analysis: auto-detection of **open source** dependencies, identification of vulnerabilities and malicious components, verification of license compatibility, formation of a list of software components and construction of a dependency graph;
- **CodeScoring.Secrets** – search for secrets in code: orchestration of source code checks for confidential information (**secrets**) and assessment of truth using our own machine learning model;
